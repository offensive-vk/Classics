ANSI C defines a number of macros that you can use, but you cannot directly modify these predefined macros

| Macro      | Description                                      |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| __DATE__   | The current date, a character constant in the format "MMM DD YYYY" |
| __TIME__   | The current time, a character constant in the format "HH:MM:SS" |
| __FILE__   | This will contain the current filename, a string constant |
| __LINE__   | This will contain the current line number, a decimal constant |
| __STDC__   | Defined as 1 when the compiler compiles against the ANSI standard |
