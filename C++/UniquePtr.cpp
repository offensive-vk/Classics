/**
std::unique_ptr is a smart pointer provided by the C++ Standard Library. It is a template class that is used for managing single objects or arrays.

unique_ptr works on the concept of exclusive ownership - meaning only one unique_ptr is allowed to own an object at a time. This ownership can be transferred or moved, but it cannot be shared or copied.
