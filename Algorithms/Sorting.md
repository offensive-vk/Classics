# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are methods used to rearrange elements in a list or array into a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Some common sorting algorithms include:

- Bubble Sort: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, repeatedly passing through the list.

- Selection Sort: Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

- Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

- Merge Sort: Divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

- Quick Sort: Divides the list into two parts based on a pivot element, sorts each part, and then combines them.

- Heap Sort: Converts the list into a heap structure, repeatedly removes the maximum element, and rebuilds the heap.

- Radix Sort: Sorts numbers by processing individual digits from least significant to most significant.

*Each algorithm has different performance characteristics and is suitable for different types of data and use cases.*
