The *algorithm* header file in C++ is part of the C++ Standard Library and contains a collection of functions for performing various operations on sequences of elements, such as arrays, vectors, and other container types. These functions facilitate a wide range of common tasks such as searching, sorting, counting, manipulating, and transforming data. Below is an overview of what is typically included in the <algorithm> header file:

1. Sorting Algorithms
std::sort: Sorts the elements in a range.
std::stable_sort: Sorts the elements while maintaining the relative order of equivalent elements.
std::partial_sort: Sorts the first part of a range.
std::nth_element: Partially sorts a range so that a particular element is sorted correctly, with all elements before it being less and all elements after being greater.
2. Searching Algorithms
std::find: Finds the first occurrence of a value in a range.
std::find_if: Finds the first element satisfying a condition.
std::binary_search: Checks if a value exists in a sorted range.
std::lower_bound, std::upper_bound: Finds the bounds of a range of elements equivalent to a value in a sorted range.
std::equal_range: Finds both bounds of a range of elements equivalent to a value in a sorted range.
3. Counting Algorithms
std::count: Counts the number of elements in a range that are equal to a value.
std::count_if: Counts the number of elements satisfying a condition.
4. Minimum and Maximum
std::min, std::max: Returns the smaller or larger of two elements.
std::min_element, std::max_element: Returns the smallest or largest element in a range.
std::minmax: Returns a pair with the smaller and larger of two elements.
std::minmax_element: Returns a pair with the smallest and largest elements in a range.
5. Permutations and Combinations
std::next_permutation, std::prev_permutation: Generates the next or previous lexicographical permutation of a range.
6. Modifying Sequence Operations
std::copy, std::copy_if: Copies elements from one range to another.
std::move: Moves elements from one range to another.
std::swap, std::swap_ranges: Swaps elements or ranges.
std::transform: Applies a function to each element in a range and stores the result in another range.
std::replace, std::replace_if: Replaces elements in a range with a new value.
std::fill: Fills a range with a value.
std::generate: Fills a range with values generated by a function.
std::remove, std::remove_if: Removes elements from a range (logically, without reducing the container's size).
7. Partitioning Operations
std::partition, std::stable_partition: Reorders elements in a range so that elements satisfying a condition come before others.
std::partition_point: Finds the partition point in a partitioned range.
8. Heap Operations
std::make_heap: Converts a range into a heap.
std::push_heap: Adds an element to a heap.
std::pop_heap: Removes the largest element from a heap.
std::sort_heap: Sorts a heap.
9. Set Operations
std::set_union: Computes the union of two sorted ranges.
std::set_intersection: Computes the intersection of two sorted ranges.
std::set_difference: Computes the difference of two sorted ranges.
std::set_symmetric_difference: Computes the symmetric difference of two sorted ranges.
10. Other Utility Functions
std::for_each: Applies a function to each element in a range.
std::accumulate: Computes the sum of a range.
std::adjacent_find: Finds the first occurrence of two consecutive elements that are equal.
std::unique: Removes consecutive duplicate elements in a range.
std::reverse, std::reverse_copy: Reverses the elements in a range.
std::rotate, std::rotate_copy: Rotates the elements in a range.
std::is_sorted, std::is_sorted_until: Checks if a range is sorted.
std::lexicographical_compare: Compares two ranges lexicographically.
