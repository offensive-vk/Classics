Introduction to Shells
A shell is a program that provides the traditional user interface for the Unix operating system and its variants. It is a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands.

Types of Shells
Bourne Shell (sh): The original Unix shell, it's simple and efficient but lacks advanced features.

Bourne Again Shell (bash): A superset of the Bourne shell with additional features like command line editing, job control, and improved scripting capabilities.

C Shell (csh): Introduced some interactive features like history substitution and job control inspired by C programming language syntax.

Korn Shell (ksh): Developed by David Korn at Bell Labs, it combines features of the Bourne shell and C shell with enhancements for scripting.

Z Shell (zsh): An extended Bourne shell with many improvements, including advanced scripting capabilities, improved command line editing, and extensive customization options.

Basic Shell Commands
cd: Change directory.
ls: List directory contents.
pwd: Print working directory.
mkdir: Make directory.
rm: Remove files or directories.
cp: Copy files or directories.
mv: Move or rename files or directories.
cat: Concatenate and display file content.
echo: Display a line of text.
Simple Shell Script Example

Here's a simple shell script that takes a name as input and greets the user:

#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user to enter their name
echo "Hello! Please enter your name:"

# Read user input into a variable
read name

# Greet the user
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to the world of shell scripting."
====================
Save this script into a file named greet.sh, make it executable with the command chmod +x greet.sh, and then execute it with ./greet.sh.
