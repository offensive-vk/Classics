In Bash scripting, the declare keyword is used to declare variables and set their properties explicitly. It allows you to specify attributes such as the variable's type, its scope, and whether it's readonly or not. The declare keyword is commonly used in more advanced shell scripting scenarios where precise control over variables is necessary.

Here's a brief overview of some common options used with the declare keyword:

-a: Specifies an array variable.
-i: Specifies an integer variable.
-r: Makes the variable readonly.
-x: Specifies an exported variable (available in the environment of subsequently executed commands).
-p: Prints the attributes and values of variables.

Example ::
declare -i number   # Declares an integer variable
declare -a fruits   # Declares an array variable
declare -r constant="This variable is readonly"
declare -x exported="This variable is exported"
