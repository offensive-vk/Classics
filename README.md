# **What is C** ?
C is a general-purpose, low level computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential.
C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions.

- Paradigm - Multi-paradigm: imperative (procedural), structured
- Designed by **Dennis Ritchie**
- First appeared - 1972; (50+ years ago)
- Typing discipline	- Static, weak, manifest, nominal
- OS - Cross-platform
- Filename extensions .c, .h

# **What is C++** ?
C++ is a general-purpose, high level, object based, statically typed programming language developed as an extension of the C programming language. 
C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

- Paradigms - Multi-paradigm: procedural, imperative, functional, object-oriented, generic, modular
- Designed by **Bjarne Stroustrup**
- First appeared in 1985; (39 years ago)
- Typing discipline - Static, strong, nominative, partially inferred
- OS - Cross-platform
- Filename extensions	- .C, .cc, .cpp, .cxx, .c++, .h, .H, .hh, .hpp, .hxx, .h++ .cppm, .ixx.

# Classics - C and C++ Programs
This Repo Contains All of My C & C++ Programs.

## Sample Code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
int main(int *argc, char **argv[]) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 1000000000)
    {
        i++;
    }
    std::cout << "Hello Users !!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
You are allowed to copy and implement these programs freely.
