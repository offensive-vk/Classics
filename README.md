# What is C++?
C++ is a general-purpose, high level, object based, statically typed programming language developed as an extension of the C programming language. 
C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.

# C and C++ Programs
This Repo Contains All of My C & C++ Programs.

## Sample Code:
```c++
#include <iostream>
int main(int *argc, char **argv[]) {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 1000000000)
    {
        i++;
    }
    std::cout << "Hello Users !!" << std::endl;
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```
You are allowed to copy and implement these programs freely.
